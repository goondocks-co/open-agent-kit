  # Capability tiers for prompt complexity adaptation
  # Codex uses OpenAI's first-party models
  reasoning_tier: high          # high | medium | basic - o-series models excel at reasoning
  context_handling: large       # large | medium | small - good context window
  model_consistency: high       # high | medium | variable - first-party models are consistent

  # Skills support (Codex supports SKILL.md files in .codex/skills/)

settings:
  # Auto-approval settings for oak commands
  # Codex uses global TOML config (~/.codex/config.toml) that affects ALL projects
  # We don't auto-manage this to avoid affecting the user's global configuration
  # User can manually set approval_policy to 'on-request' or 'on-failure' for auto-approval
  auto_approve:
    enabled: false
    file: "~/.codex/config.toml"
    format: toml
    # Note: No per-command approval in Codex - uses approval_policy (untrusted|on-failure|on-request|never)
