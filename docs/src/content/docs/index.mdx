## Why OAK?

AI agents typically "forget" everything when you start a new session. OAK solves this:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Persistent Memory" icon="pencil">
    OAK remembers gotchas, architectural decisions, and bug fixes across sessions — preventing regressive bugs and circular conversations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Semantic Search" icon="magnifier">
    Agents find code by *concept* ("where is auth?") rather than just regex, using AST-aware indexing and vector embeddings.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Live Auto-Capture" icon="rocket">
    OAK watches your agent's actions and automatically records new learnings — no manual tagging required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Universal Compatibility" icon="laptop">
    Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Gemini, Codex, and any MCP-compatible agent.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Start

<Steps>

1. **Install OAK**

   ```bash
   # macOS / Linux
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goondocks-co/open-agent-kit/main/install.sh | sh

   # Or via pipx (recommended)
   pipx install oak-ci

   # Or via uv
   uv tool install oak-ci
   ```

2. **Initialize your project**

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   oak init              # Interactive mode — pick your agent(s) and languages
   ```

3. **Start the daemon and open the dashboard**

   ```bash
   oak ci start --open
   ```

   The dashboard opens in your browser. From here, you can configure embedding models, browse sessions, search your codebase, and manage memories — all from the UI.

</Steps>

That's it! OAK is now running. **The dashboard is your primary interface** — use it to configure settings, explore agent activity, search code, and manage project memory. The CLI is only needed for [setup and maintenance tasks](/open-agent-kit/cli/).
