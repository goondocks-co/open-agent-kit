name: documentation
display_name: "README & Overview"
agent_type: documentation
description: |
  Maintains the main README.md and ensures it accurately reflects the project.
  Updates table of contents, installation instructions, and quick start guide.

default_task: |
  Review and update README.md to reflect the current state of OAK.

  **Step 1: Gather project context**
  Run these CI queries:
  1. ci_project_stats → Get overview of codebase structure
  2. ci_search "installation" type=code → Find setup/install code
  3. ci_search "getting started" type=plans → Find onboarding docs
  4. ci_memories filter=gotcha limit=10 → Find critical gotchas for quick start

  **Step 2: Review README sections**
  Ensure these sections are accurate:
  - Project description and value proposition
  - Installation instructions (match actual setup process)
  - Quick Start guide (simplest path to working)
  - Features list (match actual features in src/open_agent_kit/features/)
  - Documentation table of contents (link to docs/*)

  **Step 3: Update documentation index**
  Verify the "## Documentation" section links to:
  - docs/features/*.md (feature docs)
  - docs/architecture/*.md (architecture docs)
  - CHANGELOG.md

  **Step 4: Surface critical gotchas**
  Add a "⚠️ Important Notes" section if there are critical gotchas
  that users should know before getting started.
