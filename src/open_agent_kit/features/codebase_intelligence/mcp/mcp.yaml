# MCP Server Configuration for Codebase Intelligence
#
# This configuration defines the MCP server that agents can use
# for semantic code search and persistent memory.
#
# Agent-specific MCP registration is handled by the Python MCPInstaller class,
# which reads configuration from each agent's manifest.yaml mcp: section.
# No shell scripts are needed - it's all done in Python for cross-platform support.
