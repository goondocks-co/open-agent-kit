  # Capability tiers for prompt complexity adaptation
  # Windsurf can use various models via Cascade
  reasoning_tier: variable      # high | medium | basic | variable - depends on selected model
  context_handling: large       # large | medium | small - Cascade handles context well
  model_consistency: variable   # high | medium | variable - user can switch models
